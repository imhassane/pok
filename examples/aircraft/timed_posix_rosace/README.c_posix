This implementation of ROSACE is autonomous and should
execute properly on any POSIX compliant system with pthread support.

Description:

The implementation is made of 5 threads running at various frequencies.
The frequencies are explained in the code itself.
Synchronisation between threads is done using pthread_barrier primitives.
